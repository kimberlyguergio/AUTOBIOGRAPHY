                    <h3>My Childhood</h3>
                    <p> I was born into a very adorable and simple family. Every member of my family is very caring and loving. I have three siblings,
                        of which two are brothers and one is a sister. We all used to play together with my friends. I clearly remember all the games we
                        used to play, like Patentero, Luksong Baka, Luksong Lubid, Chinese Garter, Baril-Barilan, etc. 
                        In childhood, there was not a huge list of duties to do. We could do whatever we wanted. One of the memories I will never forget 
                        is flying kites near the seashore. I'm happy if the air is strong because the stronger the air, the higher the kite will fly. 
                        I'm so glad that I can experience games that the next generation can't because of these emerging technologies. 
                        There is no doubt that childhood is the best part of one's life.</p>

                    <h3>My Teenage Life</h3>
                    <p>
                      My life as a teenager is so wonderful. Though sometimes I experience doubts, and some teenagers will say that my life is boring, 
                      I'm very sure that I'm on the right track because my parents always guide me. Taking their advice will help me understand myself better. 
                      It helped me become a better person.I'm proud of myself for all the things that I have been through and the challenges that I have overcome.
                       I'm thinking and analyzing everything to make my life as a teenager as good as ever, with no regrets but good memories to reminisce about when the time comes. 
                      Teenage life is the most exciting and memorable experience that one should treasure!

                    <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
        
                    <p>
                      As an adult, you must be mature and ready to take on the world. This is a stage in life that I was not prepared for and wish could have been avoided. 
                      Take me back to being 8 and my toys being the only things I have to worry about. As an adult, I always wanted to be successful. Being successful to me
                       has never meant being rich, for me, it's more about not struggling, having family, and most of all, being happy. Many responsibilities come into play.

                        <figcaption>
                            This is Shawarma, My Favorite Food. I love this food because the meat satisfies your craving 
                            of eating something tasty without adding extra fat to your body. The way the meat is grilled indeed added to that undeniably great taste.
                            Moreover, it contains various vegetables and sauces and can be eaten in multiple ways. That gives people its authentic taste and unique experience.

                       it's how they deliver that "kilig" scenes that get me. Also, the characters and actors are so good!

                    Of course, I had to include K-Pop on this list because it is one of reasons why I love South Korea.
